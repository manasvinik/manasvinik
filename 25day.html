<h1>The 25 Day Challenge</h1>

<p>Inspired by Jennifer Dewalt’s 6 month learning sprint, and subsequently Thuongvu Ho‘s 100 day challenge, I started my own month (or rather, 25 day) long challenge to learn Django, by making one Django web app a day.</p>

<p>Immersion is best when you’re learning something new. Apparently, if John Grisham has done his research, the way the Powers-that-Be train monolingual secret agents to become efficient undercover spies with flawless accents, is by dumping them in the middle of the foreign country and abandoning them for a few months. Hey, nobody said being in the secret service was easy. And when their exile is over, I assume the spies emerge holding a martini and throwing around idiomatic phrases.</p>

<p>All of which goes to prove that there’s a lot to immersion learning. It’s a pity we don’t really get opportunities to do more of it in school or college.</p>

<p>I’d decided to learn to code this year. Not in an theoretical way where I can solve problems that Codeacademy gives me, but to be actually able to build things- web apps with Django in particular. I want to be at least good enough to be able to rapidly develop a prototype or MVP of any idea I have.</p>

<p>The language I initially settled on was Python, a choice I’ve never had occasion to regret. I like Python– it’s clear, readable, and feels intuitive in many ways. Also, I knew that eventually I’d want to work with law and language, and Python is the ideal choice for that. When I started the project, I’d already worked my way through Codeacademy’s Python track, Zed Shaw’s Learning Python the Hard Way and the University of Reddit course, most of Tango with Django, and attempted the Django Polls tutorial, so I wasn’t a complete beginner. I was very new to Django, however.</p>

<h2>Initial Frustrations</h2>

<p>I postponed starting the challenge till I knew my way around the basics of Django, which was a good decision in retrospect, considering it took me a ridiculous period of time — nearly a fortnight, before I successfully deployed my first “Hello World” app. Setting up the environment drove me up the wall, and when I found out my computer didn’t even support virtualization, I had to swap it for another one. When I saw the first “Hello World” text – strangely bare, devoid of CSS, it still felt like a huge challenge overcome.</p>

Visible Improvement is exciting

<p>The best, and the most exciting part of doing a challenge like this — you can see yourself getting better, right before your eyes!<p>

<p>Day 1: <a href="https://blooming-ridge-7936.herokuapp.com">Landing Page</a></p>

<p>Day 4: <a href="https://serene-fjord-9765.herokuapp.com/">Foodie</a></p>

<p>Day 7: <a href="https://stormy-eyrie-8613.herokuapp.com/">TIL</a></p>

<p>Day 13: <a href="http://somerset.herokuapp.com/">Somerset</a></p> 

<p>Day 22: <a href="http://breadoflife.herokuapp.com/">Bread of Life</a></p> 

<h2>Technology</h2>

<p>So much learnt in under a month. I used all of the following in various apps.</p>

<p>HTML, CSS</p>
<p>Javascript, Jquery</p>
<p>Front-end frameworks: Bootstrap, Skeleton</p>

<p>Backend:</p>
<p>Python</p>
<p>Framework: Django</p>
<p>Version control: Git</p>

<h2>APIs:</h2>
<p>I used the Beeminder, Google Drive, Google Maps, Locu, Foursquare, Netflix Roulette, NLP (Sentiment Analysis), and the Yoda API for various apps.</p>

<h2>Libraries</h2>

<p>Many, many libraries used. Some ‘prominent’ ones: I used a lot of NLTK in several of my apps, with help from the NLTK book. I also used Chartit.</p>

<h1>Learnings</h1>
<h2>Finish fast</h2>

<p>The project forced me to have something ready every day – and to finish something every day. That was a great thing – finishing something is important, much more so than beginning.</p>
<h2>Failing is okay</h2>

<p>Many of my apps are failures, at least to my eyes. You’ll find me whining about them in the posts. Of course, many of the apps will have bugs, and some look downright terrible. That’s okay. This challenge was all about speed, accelerated learning, and you can’t spend time adjusting text shadows and playing with css.</p>

<p>This is a story I found on Thuongvu Ho’s blog, which touched a chord.</p>

    A ceramics teacher announced on opening day that he was dividing the class into two groups.

    All those on the left side of the studio, he said, would be graded solely on the quantity of work they produced, all those on the right solely on its quality.

    His procedure was simple: on the final day of class he would bring in his bathroom scales and weigh the work of the “quantity” group: 50 pounds of pots rated an “A”, 40 pounds a “B”, and so on.

    Those being graded on “quality”, however, needed to produce only one pot — albeit a perfect one — to get an “A”.

    Well, came grading time and a curious fact emerged: the works of highest quality were all produced by the group being graded for quantity.

    It seems that while the “quantity” group was busily churning out piles of work—and learning from their mistakes — the “quality” group had sat theorizing about perfection, and in the end had little more to show for their efforts than grandiose theories and a pile of dead clay.

<h2>Instant Gratification can be a good thing</h2>

<p>The Django tutorial leaps to mind. It’s a good tutorial, and when I came back to it in the middle of the project to build the Believe it Or Not app, I found it very useful. But all I wanted to do when I’d just started learning was to see something up there, just a Hello World, and not endlessly fiddle with the admin layout. When you’re still swimming in Part 2 of a seemingly never-ending, complicated (for your level) tutorial, it’s easy to give up. Instead, it’s best to start small, finish doing something, and use that momentum to move on to more complicated projects.</p>

<h1>Result</h1>

<p>So, 25 apps made in 25 days. I finished with the confidence that I’d be able to quickly prototype any app I wanted to make. I wouldn’t be completely lost. Even if I didn’t know exactly what to do, I had experience in searching for answers, applying different solutions to problems, solving problems as soon as possible and moving on. I had experience in shipping an app. I’d figure it out.</p>
