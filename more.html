    <br><br>

    <h3>Writing</h3>
    <p>I also occasionally write speculative fiction, mostly fantasy (cleverly disguised as science-fiction) and fantasy (featuring gods, demi-gods and war picks). 
    Here are some of my <a href="stories.html">published stories</a>.</p>

    <h3>Coding</h3>
    <p>I decided to teach myself to code to be able to make MVPs. I made 25 Django projects in 25 days, to get familiar with making and shipping. You can see the <a href="challenge.html">finished projects here</a>.</p>

    <h3>Productivity</h3>
    <p>I am a bit of a productivity nerd. If there's a productivity app out there, chances are I've tried it. I love many of them (<a href="https://www.beeminder.com/">Beeminder</a>, <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/productivity-owl/eoagmdboiealblmpaahjlhajggndaahi?hl=en">Productivity Owl</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wlxd.pomochallenge&hl=en">Productivity Challenge Timer</a> being my favourites, in case you're wondering) but nothing seemed to really stick, or 'get' me. For a while, I secretly nourished the belief that the perfect to-do app for me existed. Somewhere out there. And when we meet each other, sparks will fly, it will be a match made in heaven, and someone might make a movie about it. In the end, I decided to just make it myself. While the vision might change a bit, right now it's looking like a more powerful version of Carrot -- an AI that organizes your tasks and ensures you're productive. If you'd like to be notified when this is usable, please <a href="https://getserendipity.typeform.com/to/HxmNMP">let me know here</a>.</p>
